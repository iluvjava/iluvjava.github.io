    - Drop down manu will be created by the script. id="my-dropdown-manu"
        - Scan all elements with class: "passage Entry"
        - Add then passge title to the dropdown list as <li>
    - Hide unviewing passages on page
        - Make one of the passage entry to be on page by default. 
        - Default unhidden must be manually coded in.
