                            In 1950, a group of physicists met to discuss recent newspaper reports on sightings of UFO's (Unidentified Flying Objects). During this lunchtime conversation, Enrico Fermi, a Nobel Prize winner in physics, asked the question, "So, where are they?" -- by which he meant, "where are the aliens." His point was that, with so many stars in the Milky Way, it should be expected that the conditions for life would exist in many places in our galaxy -- not just on the Earth. If life exists, then evolution would be expected to lead to intelligent species and eventually technological civilizations. Yet science has so far found no trace of alien civilizations, despite the considerable effort devoted to projects such as SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). 
                            <br>
                            While alien civilizations are typically the prerogative of science fiction, there is nevertheless a serious scientific purpose to the search of evidence of other civilizations. If humanity is indeed as singular case, there must be an explanation as to why our star (the sun), our solar system and our planet are unique. Many theories have been proposed to explain the apparent lack of other life forms. Life, and especially intelligent life, may in fact be exceedingly rare, or such life exists and we have neither found it, been able to contact it, or we simply have not noticed it. Each of these points of view has many different theories associated with it, making the "Fermi paradox" an active area of research and scientific thought, especially in the emerging field of astrobiology.

                            In the Ptolemaic cosmology the earth is regarded as an fixed point with the other planets revolving around it.One reason for supposing that the earth is not moving is that if you drop an object it falls straight to the ground; if the earth was moving, Ptolemy reasoned that it would fall in a different place because the earth would move in between when you released the object and when it hit the ground. In fact, this is incorrect as can be demonstrated by dropping an object (keys for example) while walking. The keys do not fall to the ground at the place you stood when you release them but at the place you are, roughly speaking, when the keys hit the ground. In other words the keys move with you after  you let them go, as long as you keep going with the same speed. This was first explained by Galileo in his famous work "Dialogue concerning the Two Chief World Systems," When the keys are released they have same forward velocity with respect to the earth as you, the walker, do. In addition they experience a gravitational force pulling them down. So they drop to the ground while maintaining the same forward velocity, assuming we can neglect the drag of air, and arrive at the same place as your feet. In a similar manner Galileo argue that you would you would not be able to tell if the earth is moving or not by experiments down on earth, thereby removing an important obstacle to the heliocentric (sun centered) cosmology of Copernicus. Today the principle that the laws of mechanics are the same in any fame moving with a constant velocity is called "Valilean Invariance, " and would play a crucial role in Einstein's development of special relativity.
