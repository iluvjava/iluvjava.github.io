Difference between QA and QC: 
    - QA: Ensuring quality in the processes of developing the products. 
    - Focus on preventing defects rather than fixing and identifying defects. 
    - Statistical Techniques are applied for problems in QA and QC. 

Smoke Testing: 
    - Assuring that the critical functionalities are working properly. 
Sanity Testing: 
    - Assuring that the proposed functionalities are working properly

Difference between Validation and Verification: 
- Verification: 
    - Verifying the process of design, code, and program. 
    - Executing the code is not involved.
    - Verification uses methods like reviews, walk through, inspections, and desk checking etc.
    - Whether the software conforms to specification is checked. 
- Validation: 
    - It is a dynamic mechanism of testing and validating the actual product
    - It always involves executing the code
    - It uses methods like Black Box Testing, White Box Testing, and non-functional testing. 


- Bug Life Cycles: 
     - New -> Assign -> Active -> Test -> Reopened -> Active
                               -> Rejected
                               -> Deferred
                               -> Test -> Verified -> Closed
